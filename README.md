# SCA-onset
- This application uses RSF (random survival forest) to predict the probability that a non-affected person with a pathological allele for SCA3 and DRPLA at a given age will remain unaffected in subsequent years.
- This application is based on data from 292 SCA3 and 203 DRPLA cases. A 100 % asymptomatic probability does not mean that 100 % of the patients will not develop the disease.
## Install
- If you are a Windows 64 bit user, download all files and run SCAonsetv1.0.exe.
- If not, run SCAonsetv1.0.py in Python. SCAonsetv1.0.py requires pandas, matplotlib and numpy to be installed.
